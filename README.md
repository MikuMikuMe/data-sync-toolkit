# data-sync-toolkit

Creating a robust data synchronization toolkit that includes conflict resolution and logging capabilities requires a detailed understanding of the systems you're synchronizing as well as their specific data models. Below is a simplified version of a data synchronization tool in Python, which provides the basis for synchronizing data between two disparate systems. This example includes basic conflict resolution and logging.

```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='data_sync_toolkit.log', 
                    level=logging.DEBUG, 
                    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class DataSyncToolkit:
    def __init__(self, source_system, destination_system):
        """
        Initialize with two systems. Each system should be capable
        of listing, retrieving, and storing data.
        """
        self.source = source_system
        self.destination = destination_system
    
    def fetch_data(self):
        """
        Fetch data from source system.
        """
        try:
            data = self.source.retrieve_data()
            logging.info("Data fetched from the source system.")
            return data
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error fetching data from source: {e}")
            raise

    def sync_data(self, data):
        """
        Synchronize data to the destination system with conflict resolution.
        """
        try:
            for item in data:
                src_id = item['id']
                dest_item = self.destination.get_item_by_id(src_id)

                if dest_item:
                    # Conflict resolution
                    src_last_modified = datetime.strptime(item['last_modified'], "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
                    dest_last_modified = datetime.strptime(dest_item['last_modified'], "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
                    
                    if src_last_modified > dest_last_modified:
                        self.destination.update_item(item)
                        logging.info(f"Updated item {src_id} in destination system.")
                    else:
                        logging.info(f"Skipped updating item {src_id} - no newer data.")
                else:
                    self.destination.create_item(item)
                    logging.info(f"Created item {src_id} in destination system.")
        
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error during data synchronization: {e}")
            raise

    def execute_sync(self):
        """
        Execute the data synchronization process.
        """

            self.sync_data(data)
            logging.info("Data synchronization process completed successfully.")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Failed to complete data synchronization: {e}")

# Mock systems for demonstration purposes
class MockSystem:
    def retrieve_data(self):
        return [
            {'id': 1, 'last_modified': '2023-10-05T12:00:00', 'data': 'Sample data 1'},
            {'id': 2, 'last_modified': '2023-10-06T15:00:00', 'data': 'Sample data 2'}
        ]

        # Mock update item in system
        pass

### Key Components:
- **Logging**: Python's built-in logging module is used to log important steps and errors during execution.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Uses `last_modified` timestamps to determine which data item to keep during conflicts.
- **Error Handling**: Wrapped major operations with try-except blocks to capture and log exceptions.
- **Mock Systems**: Used here to simulate data sources/destinations. In practice, these would interface with actual data systems like databases, file storage, or APIs.

### Notes:
- This example assumes the minimal structure of data being synced; you'll likely need to adjust to fit specific data schemas.
- Real-life applications should use secure data handling, better connection management, and potentially deal with network issues if systems are remote.
- Consider using libraries suited for particular data sync needs (e.g., pandas for data frames, databases connectors for SQL/NoSQL etc.).

This program is a foundation and should be tailored to meet the specific requirements of the actual systems you work with.
